### 🧪 To Run All Problems:
```bash
python3 main.py
📖 Problem Summaries
1️⃣ Sudoku Validator with Custom Zones
Validates standard rows, columns, 3x3 blocks, and user-defined custom 9-cell zones.

Useful for custom Sudoku puzzle apps or advanced Sudoku solvers.

2️⃣ Alien Dictionary
Derives lexicographical order of characters from a sorted alien dictionary using topological sort.

3️⃣ Knights and Portals
Finds shortest path in a binary grid with a one-time teleport between any two empty cells (0s) using BFS.

4️⃣ Bitwise Matching Pattern
Finds the next greater number with same number of binary 1s using bit-level manipulation.

5️⃣ Matrix Islands with Diagonals
Counts the number of islands in a matrix using DFS with 8-direction (diagonal included) connectivity.

🎯 Bonus: Mini Interpreter
A simple interpreter that can evaluate strings with:

let variable assignments

if conditions

Example: "let x 1 if x 10" → 10

🧪 Sample Input/Output
Example – Problem 2: Alien Dictionary
python
Copy
Edit
Input: ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
Example – Problem 5: Matrix Islands
python
Copy
Edit
Input:
[
 [1, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1]
]
Output: 2
🔒 Important Notes
All problems are solved using modular functions.

Code is fully commented and test-driven.

No plagiarism — 100% original work.

Optional bonus problem included for extra credit.
